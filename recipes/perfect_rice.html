        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
            This rice is rich, buttery, and so comforting.
            It is cooked perfectly, not mushy or sticky, and has a nice savory flavor.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups of rice</li>
            <li>A pitch of salt</li>
            <li>Chicken stock or water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat each grain of rice in the butter before boiling</li>
            <li>Season with salt and add any aromatics that you want</li>
            <li>The longer the rice is toasted in the butter, the deeper the flavor will be.</li>
            <li>
                You can stir the rice once when you add the liquid and once more when it comes to a boil, 
                but that’s it! Cover the pot and don’t peek until it’s done.
            </li>
        </ol>
